Hadoop Installation

The below mentioned steps are used to install Apache Hadoop. This installation is only for the Hadoop downloaded from Apache and not based on any Distribution. This one gives a detailed step for Single node cluster.


Step 1: Install Java

Since Hadoop is mostly written in Java, we need to install JDK packages to run Hadoop. There are two different things JRE and JDK. JRE provides runtime environment for java programs. It has libraries that allows java program to run. JDK also known as Java Development Kit is Software Development Kit which helps developers use libraries to develop a application .

To install java , goto terminal and type

>> sudo apt-get update

This command will update the libraries. It is always better to update java before installing Hadoop, otherwise there might be a mismatch in Hadoop configuration to java. Which will make Hadoop stop working.

>> sudo apt-get install default-jdk

This command will download and install the files and libraries for the JDK.

Step 2: Create user group

Since in the enterprise everyone will have different user permissions, its always good to have user group

>> sudo add group Hadoop

This command will create a group called Hadoop.

Step 3: Create user and add it group

>> sudo adducer --ingroup Hadoop hduser

This command will create user hduser and add it the the group Hadoop

Step 4: install Ssh

SSH is secure shell is a protocol which is used to connect over a network security ,even when the network is unsecured this connection provides safe means for the data to be transmitted and received.

>>sudo apt-get install ssh

This command will install ssh protocol

Step 5 : create Leyden

keygen is like a key which is unique, its needs to be generated for a connection to be made over ssh

>>ssh-keygen -t rsa -P ""

This command creates a ssh key 

Step 6: copy key to another file.

>>cat $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> $HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys

This command copies the data from id_rsa.pub to authorised key so that we can use the key to connect 

Step 7: download the Hadoop file.

>>wget http://mirrors.sonic.net/apache/hadoop/common/hadoop-2.6.5/hadoop-2.6.5-src.tar.gz

This command will download the Hadoop files.

Step 8: unzip

goto the location of the downloaded Hadoop files and unzip it using the command

>>tar xvzf hadoop-2.6.0.tar.gz

This will unzip the files
